A **simple command-line calculator** built in Go! This project was one of my first experiences with the Go programming language, and it served as a hands-on introduction to the basics of Go syntax, logic, and structuring code. ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸš€ Features

-   Supports basic arithmetic operations:
    -   **Addition (+)**
    -   **Subtraction (-)**
    -   **Multiplication (\*)**
    -   **Division (/)**
-   Clean and minimal command-line interface (CLI).
-   A great starting point for anyone learning Go or exploring CLI-based tools.
